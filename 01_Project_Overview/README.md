# Project Overview

## Background

This project was developed for MBI807B – Business Intelligence & Data Warehousing.

The objective was to design and implement an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution including:

- Data extraction and transformation (ETL)
- Data warehouse schema design
- SQL analytical layer
- Power BI dashboards for decision support

The project follows a structured BI pipeline:
Raw Data → ETL → Data Warehouse → Analytics Layer → Dashboard Insights

## Business Objective

To transform structured datasets into a warehouse-ready model that supports:

- Trend analysis
- Market segmentation
- Comparative performance analysis
- Decision-oriented reporting

## Methodology

1. Data Extraction and Cleaning
2. Warehouse Schema Design (Fact + Dimension tables)
3. SQL Query Development
4. BI Dashboard Development in Power BI
5. Validation and Insight Interpretation

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas) for ETL
- SQL (DDL and analytical queries)
- Power BI (data modelling + DAX)
- GitHub (documentation & version control)
